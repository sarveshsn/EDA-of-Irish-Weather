    "## Exploratory data analysis of the Irish weather\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment you will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of historic weather data from Met Eireann, Ireland's main meteorological service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "* Solutions must be submitted on Brightspace under *Assessments* $\\rightarrow$ *Midterm Assignment*.\n",
    "* Your submission must include your completed Jupyter notebook in .ipynb **and** PDF format. To create a PDF of your notebook select *File* $\\rightarrow$ *Download as* $\\rightarrow$ *PDF via LaTeX (.pdf)*.\n",
    "* All of the results that you wish to include should be viewable without running the Python code. Note that the code may still be run by the grader to check that it functions properly and as intended.\n",
    "* Marks will be awarded for complete and correct answers to all 9 questions. An additional 10 marks will be reserved for organisation, presentation and conciseness.\n",
    "* For full marks, you must justify your answers, clearly explain all steps and computations, label your figures, and write concise code.\n",
    "* The assignment must be completed individually. \n",
