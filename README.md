# Exploratory Data Analysis of Irish Weather

### Year : 2022

This Python project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Irish weather dataset for the year 2021. The dataset includes various weather measurements recorded daily at three different weather stations: Dublin Airport, Shannon Airport, and Cork Airport.

## Introduction
This Python project aims to analyze and visualize the Irish weather data recorded in 2021. By conducting an exploratory data analysis, we will gain insights into various weather parameters and their variations across different months and stations.

## Load Data and Initial Description
The project starts by loading essential Python packages and importing the weather data from a CSV file. The initial description provides information about the number of years recorded, the temporal resolution of the data, and the specific weather measurements included in the dataset.

## Handling Missing Data
This section discusses strategies for handling missing data in the dataset. Various approaches, including using regression models, replacing values with means or medians, and utilizing information from other columns and rows, are explored.

## Weather Stations and Extremes
Answers to specific questions about the dataset are provided in this section. These answers include the number of weather stations, the date and station with the lowest minimum air temperature, and the date and station with the highest amount of recorded rain.

## Numerical Summary
For each weather measurement, a numerical summary is presented, containing statistics such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and percentiles. These summaries offer insights into the distribution and variability of each weather parameter.

## Graphical Summaries
Graphical representations, including line plots and scatter plots, are employed to visualize trends and patterns in the data. These plots illustrate variations in different weather measurements across months and weather stations.

## Comparative Analysis
The final section involves a comprehensive comparative analysis of weather measurements at Dublin Airport, Shannon Airport, and Cork Airport. Numerical summaries and box plots are used to highlight differences and similarities in weather conditions among the three stations.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.
2. **Download the Dataset:** Download the `weather.csv` dataset from the repository and save it in the project folder.
3. **Install Required Packages:** Make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can install them using the following command:
